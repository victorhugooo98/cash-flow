# 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-04-22
Status: Accepted

## Context
As we develop the CashFlow Management System, we need to document important architectural decisions to:
- Provide context for future developers
- Record the reasoning behind choices
- Track the evolution of the system architecture

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) to document significant architectural decisions.

Each ADR will include:
- A unique identifier and title
- Date and status
- Context explaining the forces at play
- The decision made
- Consequences (positive and negative)
- Alternatives considered

## Consequences
- Improved knowledge transfer for new team members
- Better long-term maintenance through documented rationale
- Slightly increased overhead for documenting decisions

## Alternatives Considered
- Wiki documentation: Lacks structure and versioning
- Architecture documentation in code comments: Scattered and difficult to overview
- No formal documentation: Relies on tribal knowledge
