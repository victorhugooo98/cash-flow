# 0007: Clean Architecture Implementation

Date: 2025-04-22
Status: Accepted

## Context
As our microservices grow in complexity, we need a consistent architectural approach that:
- Separates concerns
- Enforces domain-centric design
- Enables testability
- Allows for technology changes over time

## Decision
Implement Clean Architecture within each microservice with the following layers:
1. Domain Layer:
    - Core business entities and logic
    - No dependencies on infrastructure or UI

2. Application Layer:
    - Use cases/application services
    - Command/query handlers
    - Interface definitions for infrastructure

3. Infrastructure Layer:
    - Database implementation
    - Messaging implementation
    - External service integration

4. API Layer:
    - HTTP endpoints (using Minimal API)
    - Request/response DTOs
    - API-specific mapping

Dependency rule: Outer layers depend on inner layers, never the reverse.

## Consequences
### Positive
- Clear separation of concerns
- Domain logic isolated from infrastructure details
- Easier to test domain and application logic
- Technology decisions can change with minimal impact

### Negative
- More initial development overhead
- More files and indirection
- Learning curve for developers
- Can lead to abstraction overuse

## Alternatives Considered
1. Traditional N-tier architecture:
    - Simpler but less domain-focused
    - Less clear dependency rules

2. Domain-Driven Design without Clean Architecture:
    - Domain focus but less technology isolation

3. CQRS without layering:
    - Separates read/write paths but lacks overall structure
