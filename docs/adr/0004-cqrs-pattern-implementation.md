# 0004: CQRS Pattern Implementation

Date: 2025-04-22
Status: Accepted

## Context
The CashFlow Management System has different read and write patterns:
- Writes: Recording individual transactions as they occur
- Reads: Querying individual transactions or aggregated reports

We need to optimize for both patterns while maintaining separation of concerns.

## Decision
Implement Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern using:
- MediatR library for in-process command/query dispatching
- Separate command and query models/handlers
- Commands return only success/failure/ID (not domain objects)
- Queries return DTOs optimized for client consumption

Core implementation components:
- Commands: CreateTransactionCommand
- Queries: GetTransactionByIdQuery, GetTransactionsByMerchantQuery, GetDailyBalanceQuery
- Command/Query handlers separated into distinct classes

## Consequences
### Positive
- Better separation of concerns
- Optimization of read and write paths independently
- Simpler command handlers (focused on validation and persistence)
- Query models can be optimized for specific UI/reporting needs

### Negative
- More code (separate models and handlers)
- Potential code duplication between command/query models
- Increased complexity in understanding the full flow

## Alternatives Considered
1. Traditional CRUD approach:
    - Simpler implementation initially
    - Would lead to mixed concerns as complexity grows

2. Full CQRS with separate read/write databases:
    - Would provide better read scalability
    - Excessive complexity for current requirements

3. Domain-driven design without CQRS:
    - Rich domain model handling all operations
    - Would complicate optimization of read operations
