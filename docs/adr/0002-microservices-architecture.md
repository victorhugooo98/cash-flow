# 0002: Microservices Architecture

Date: 2025-04-22
Status: Accepted

## Context
The CashFlow Management System needs to handle both transaction recording and daily balance consolidation. These functions have different scaling requirements and operational characteristics:
- Transaction recording needs high availability and throughput
- Consolidation service has batch processing characteristics with reporting capabilities

The non-functional requirement specifies that transaction recording must not be impacted by consolidation service outages.

## Decision
Implement a microservices architecture with two separate services:
1. Transaction Service: Handles recording financial transactions (credits/debits)
2. Consolidation Service: Maintains daily balance records based on transaction events

Each service will:
- Have its own bounded context with separate domain models
- Maintain its own database
- Be independently deployable
- Communicate primarily through asynchronous events

## Consequences
### Positive
- Independent scalability based on different workload profiles
- Isolation of failures (one service can operate when the other is down)
- Clearer domain boundaries and responsibility separation
- Easier independent evolution of services

### Negative
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for orchestration and monitoring of multiple services
- Eventual consistency between services
- More complex deployment and testing

## Alternatives Considered
1. Monolithic architecture:
    - Simpler initial development but harder to scale differentially
    - Single point of failure, violating the non-functional requirements

2. Layered architecture with runtime separation:
    - Shared codebase with runtime isolation
    - Would not provide true deployment independence
